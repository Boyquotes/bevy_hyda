# Bevy Hyda
## Run HTML (&amp; soon CSS) in the Bevy game engine!

## WARNING:
- This is 0.1.0, meaning that it can render basic HTML 4.0, its not prepared for websites that are heavily stylized.
- I've made this in two weeks in my free time for fun.
- Source code is probably ***UGLY***. (Feel free to send PRs or contribute to make the code much better :D).

## Introduction.

Bevy Hyda is a system that allows you to load HTML sites in your Bevy app/game. It is fully powered by BevyUI, so you can access, modify and use the elements like you do usually in Bevy! (without any 'but's).
